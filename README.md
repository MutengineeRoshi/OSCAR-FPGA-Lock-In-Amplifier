# SingularitySurfer-FPGA-Lock-In-Amplifier
Repository for the development of an FPGA based DSP Lock-In Amplifier

The Lattice ICE40Up5K FPGA will be used as the DSP platform and some additional hardware will be developed.
The project uses the open-source ICESTORM toolchain that is YOSYS for synthesis, NextPNR for place and route and finally ICEPACK/PROG to get it onto the FPGA. The external hardware will be developed in KiCad.
